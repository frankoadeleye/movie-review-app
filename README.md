THIS IS ABOUT BUILDING A MOVIE APP FROM SCRATCH, FETCHING DATA AND RENDERING,
WITHOUT THE USE OF LIBRARIES LIKE REDUX THUNK, OR SAGA. ALSO WE CREATED OUR OWN
CUSTOM MIDDLEWARE

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## BASE URL

YOU CAN EDIT THE BASE URL IN src/middleware/api, (I created a mockapi @
[https://mockapi.io/](https://mockapi.io/))
